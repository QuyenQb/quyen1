#pyqt_calculator

This is software created in python language.

The interface is generated from pyqt5.Qt designer.

The interface and features are copied from the windows caulator.

Some functions have not been completed, there are some calculation errors. Code used for learning.

The program consists of 2 main files:

-Main.py is used to perform computer functions.

-maytinh.py is the file that stores the interface of the caculator that I created.
